# Regression Tree

This is my implementation of a regression tree. I was only allowed to use `numpy`, `scipy` and `pandas` to complete this assignment. That's why it has some serious performance issues.
Nevertheless, I learned a lot programming this model, so I wanted to share it with the world.

*Note*: This assignment is from an Spanish-taught course, so all notebook explanations are in that language. Fortunately, I like to code in English, so I hope the code cells are self-explanatory.
